# Performance Guide

This page is a starting point for NeMo Retriever Library performance tuning guidance.

## Scope

Use this guide to document practical recommendations for:

- Extraction throughput and latency tuning
- Task-level settings (for example `extract`, `caption`, and `embed`)
- Deployment-specific tuning for library mode and Kubernetes/Helm
- NIM endpoint sizing and concurrency settings
- Benchmarking methodology and repeatable test setups

## Batch resource sizing

In batch mode, NeMo Retriever Library sizes unspecified Ray actor pools from the CPU and GPU resources that Ray reports as available immediately before the pipeline is submitted. This prevents default extraction, OCR, and embedding pools from reserving more resources than the cluster can schedule.

For filesystem inputs, the library reserves CPU capacity for each Ray Data `ReadBinary` source task before it sizes actor pools. This reservation lets the input stage start instead of being blocked by persistent extraction actors. Inputs that are already Ray datasets, such as inline text rows, do not require this reservation.

When ingestion creates multiple extraction datasets, preflight also reserves 1 CPU per dataset for possible schema-normalization work. This keeps actor pools from occupying the CPUs that join-compatible branch schemas require.

Text-only extraction targets up to 8 `MultiTypeExtractOperator` actors, limited by the available CPUs. Shared preflight can reduce this default when the same batch job requires other actor pools or task reservations.

If you set `BatchTuningParams` worker counts or direct `node_overrides`, those requests and required task reservations must fit the available Ray CPU and GPU budget. The library validates the final plan before submitting work and raises an error when it is infeasible. Reduce `*_workers` or per-node concurrency, or wait for shared-cluster capacity before retrying.

For a direct Ray actor-pool tuple, such as `(minimum, maximum)` or `(minimum, maximum, initial)`, validation uses `maximum` as the requested pool size.

Use the Ray dashboard to verify the available-resource snapshot and the planned worker allocation when you tune throughput.

## Shared preflight for custom Ray Data graphs

`GraphIngestor` reserves source capacity automatically. For custom graphs, declare source capacity before calling `preflight_executors(...)`. Set `source_cpu_reservation=1` on each `RayDataExecutor` that will receive a filesystem path or glob. `source_cpu_reservation` must be a finite, non-negative CPU value. An executor that only receives an existing Ray dataset can omit the reservation.

```python
file_executor = RayDataExecutor(graph, source_cpu_reservation=1)
inline_executor = RayDataExecutor(graph)
preflight_executors([file_executor, inline_executor], cluster_resources)
```

The shared preflight records these reservations. NeMo Retriever Library rejects a later filesystem input when its executor lacks the required reservation. It rejects the input before it starts Ray work. Construct a new executor with `source_cpu_reservation=1`, and include it in a new shared preflight instead.
