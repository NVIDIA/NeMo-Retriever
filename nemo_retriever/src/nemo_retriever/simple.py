"""The simple, verb-first API for NeMo Retriever.

This module is the friendliest way to use the library. It reads like plain
English and hides every moving part behind a handful of verbs:

    import nemo_retriever as nr

    # See what is inside your files.
    content = nr.extract("reports/")

    # Make your files searchable.
    nr.ingest("reports/", into="my-library")

    # Find the passages that match a question.
    hits = nr.search("my-library", "What were the Q3 results?")

    # Ask a question and get a written answer.
    answer = nr.ask("my-library", "What were the Q3 results?", model="...")

Every verb accepts any supported file - documents, text, web pages, images,
audio, or video - and figures out how to read each one for you. Point a verb at
a single file, a folder, a wildcard pattern, or a list of any of those.

The verbs describe *what happens*, never *how*. Speed, hardware, models, and
storage are chosen for you with sensible defaults so a first call just works.
